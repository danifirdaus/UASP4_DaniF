			<h3><a href="gps_provider.html">GPS Provider</a></h3>
			<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) uses a system of satellites orbiting the planet to help a receiver
(an Android handset in this case) determine its current location. The term GPS refers to the entire
GPS system, which consists of satellites, receivers, and the control stations that monitor and adjust
it. The receiver that is located in the phone is useless without the rest of the system.</p>

			<h3><a href="aoa.html">Android Open Accessory</a></h3>
			<p>Android Open Accessory (AOA) is a protocol that allows an Android device to interact with
external sensors and actuators via USB. This addition to the Android SDK is exciting for both
electronics hobbyists and mobile professionals because it opens up the possibilities of reacting to
real-world inputs like temperature changes and controlling real-world objects such as lights without
being limited to the current form-factor of a mobile phone or its current hardware sensors.</p>
